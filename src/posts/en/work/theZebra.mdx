At The Zebra, I advocated for the founding of the Analytics Engineering role as a key part of our Data & Engineering teams. My initial work implementing data-build-tool in conjunction with Snowflake as a “technical analyst” laid the groundwork for the Analytics Engineering team here.

I’ve worked tirelessly since then to continue improving the data environment here with new tools and frameworks such as Fivetran for out of the box ETL, funnel.io for API integration management and Prefect for our data refresh job orchestration.

My proudest moment yet within this data organization was partnering with our Data Engineering team to design a SQL unit testing framework alongside a regression testing framework to increase confidence in deployments and build trust in our data integrity.

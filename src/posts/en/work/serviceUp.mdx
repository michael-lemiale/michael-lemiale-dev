At ServiceUp, I've served as a consultant setting up BigQuery, Stitch and Looker Studio as their first baseline for reporting in addition to helping set up their first event pipeline to stream data into BigQuery.

Working with a start up, I've worked out smaller scale, cheaper and scrappier solutions to help get their reporting off the ground.

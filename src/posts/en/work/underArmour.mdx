Under Armour was foundational in my early career as a data practitioner. As an analyst on the Project 20/Twenty transition team, I partnered with SAP ERP implementation consultants to translate old data models into a new SAP HANA data environment.

This first forray into data modeling drove me to pursue more work in the data sphere as part of the core Under Armour BI team. On the BI team, I focused on creating and maintaining data models for the Retail and E-Commerce teams.

At Articulate, I led several database migrations to centralize data into Snowflake from BigQuery and Redshift.

My proudest moments here center around providing the team the processes and tools that allow them to flourish and deploy their work with confidence (Quality CI/CD pipelines, testing frameworks, rapid local environment deployments to name a few)

I've also partnered with our product engineering teams to standardize our event streaming definitions with a schema registry. This registry has helped to provide a shared language between product, data and engineering when defining new event streams.
